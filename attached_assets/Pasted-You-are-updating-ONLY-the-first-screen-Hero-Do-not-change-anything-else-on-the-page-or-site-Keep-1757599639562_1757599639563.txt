You are updating ONLY the first screen (Hero). Do not change anything else on the page or site. Keep all tokens, breakpoints, spacing, and components exactly as they are elsewhere.

OBJECTIVE
- Keep the current Hero image layout as-is (full-height image on the RIGHT, contained, not background).
- On the LEFT, place a short two-sentence art statement. This statement replaces any separate “Artist_Identity” block on the first screen (do not duplicate it elsewhere on the hero).
- The work caption may be shown as an OVERLAY CARD on top of the image OR be removed entirely.
- Everything below the hero (Mixed_Gallery_Preview, footer note, etc.) MUST remain unchanged.

LAYOUT (Hero)
- Two columns (desktop lg+): left = statement, right = hero image. On mobile, stack: statement first, image second; keep generous spacing.
- Right column: keep image behavior (object-fit: contain; full-height hero).
- Caption OVERLAY CARD (if visible): place on top of the image, pinned bottom-left, with inner padding and readable contrast.
  - Card max-width ≈ 360px; padding 12–16px; subtle shadow; z-index above image.
  - Background: translucent light layer (e.g., rgba(255,255,255,0.85)) with optional backdrop-filter blur(4px); text uses body style.
  - Entire card is a single link to the work page.
  - On mobile, pin bottom-center with safe insets; ensure 16px minimum padding from edges.
- If caption is hidden (variant “none”): remove the card from DOM (not display:none), and keep image alignment unchanged.

TYPOGRAPHY
- Use existing tokens. Recommended:
  - Statement (left): Body size (17/1.65) with slight emphasis (weight 500–600). Exactly two sentences; max-width ≈ 480px.
  - Caption (overlay, if visible): Small/meta (13/1.4) for secondary lines (year, medium) and 17/1.65 for title.
- Links use the same color as text; underline on hover/focus only.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Overlay card contrast must meet WCAG for body text.
- Provide focus-visible outline for the overlay card link.
- Image must keep alt text.

DO NOTS (critical)
- Do NOT modify navigation, Mixed_Gallery_Preview, footer, or any other sections.
- Do NOT change tokens, breakpoints, spacings elsewhere.
- Do NOT introduce new components or reorder content beyond the hero.
- Do NOT switch the image to a background image.

CONFIG FLAGS (data-driven)
- `hero.caption.visible`: boolean — show/hide overlay card.
- `hero.caption.variant`: "overlay-card" | "none"
- `hero.left.statement`: string — exactly two sentences.
- `hero.image`: unchanged (keep current source/behavior).

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Desktop: split-right layout with left statement and right image; optional caption overlay rendered as specified.
- Mobile: stacked layout; overlay card legible and not clipped; safe spacing preserved.
- No visual or structural changes outside the hero.
