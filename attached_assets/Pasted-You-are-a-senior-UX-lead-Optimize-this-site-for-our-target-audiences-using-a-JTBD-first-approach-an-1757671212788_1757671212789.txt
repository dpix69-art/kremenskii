You are a senior UX lead. Optimize this site for our target audiences using a JTBD-first approach and apply pixel-perfect fixes in ONE pass.

TARGET AUDIENCES & JTBD (use as acceptance criteria)
- Curators/Galleries: understand series logic fast; see sizes/technique; download portfolio; contact easily.
- Collectors: see size/technique; see price or “on request”; contact easily.
- Sound programmers/Labels: listen quickly; see tracks/label/platform; no autoplay; contact easily.
- Press: find statement; press kit (statement PDF + 3–5 images); contact.
- Collaborators: see cross-media range; examples with sound; contact.
- Fans: browse/view/listen calmly without confusion.

DO NOT CHANGE
- IA, routes, or our design tokens & layout constraints already defined (container 1200, grid 12 with gaps 24/24/32, badges, two-column Artwork hero, route scroll-top+focus, etc.).

WHAT TO DO (apply, then output unified diffs)
1) CONTENT & ACTION ACCESS
   - Contacts: add “Download portfolio (PDF, N MB)” next to email; ensure click-to-copy email with toast “Email copied”.
   - Statement: add a “Press kit” link (statement PDF + 3–5 press images web); repeat email.
   - Artwork meta panel: support `Availability` and `Price: on request` when price missing.
   - Sounds project: ensure NO autoplay; place player first, then Tracks, then Meta, then media.

2) SERIES PAGE
   - At the top, show `series_intro` (2–3 lines) + `year` before the works grid.
   - Ensure all works of the series render immediately.

3) CARDS & LABELS
   - Keep bottom-aligned captions with reserved badge row.
   - Use badges: Artwork/Series/Sound (placeholder if hidden), so titles don’t jump.

4) PIXEL-PERFECT & RHYTHM
   - Enforce vertical rhythm tokens (section padY 64/64/72, block gap 24/24/32, heading/paragraph/list spacing).
   - Align to left container edge on every page; no full-bleed sections.
   - Two-column Artwork hero: left image boxed-cover (88svh desktop, ~65svh mobile); right meta as <dl> with labels + About This Work (H3).

5) ACCESSIBILITY & ROUTING
   - One H1 per page; labeled dl (dt/dd); alt text on media.
   - On any route change: jump to top; focus main heading (tabindex="-1"). Keep hash behavior.

6) ANALYTICS (instrument events; show code snippets or pseudo):
   - view_artwork(series, work), view_series(series), play_sound(project, track), copy_email, download_portfolio(bytes, ver), press_kit_open.

OUTPUT (STRICT)
- SUMMARY TABLE: {Page/Area, Issues, Fix, Impact, Risk, Notes}
- PER-FILE DIFFS: unified diffs for changed files (components, pages, styles)
- PIXEL REDLINES per page: container width, gutters, grid spans, gaps, meta panel spacing
- ANALYTICS HOOKS: where events were instrumented
- TODO (if any): minimal
