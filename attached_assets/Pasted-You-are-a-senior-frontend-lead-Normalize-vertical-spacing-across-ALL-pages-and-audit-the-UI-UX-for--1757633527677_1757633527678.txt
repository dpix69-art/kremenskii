You are a senior frontend lead. Normalize vertical spacing across ALL pages and audit the UI/UX for professional-grade layout quality.

GOAL
- Enforce a consistent vertical rhythm on desktop and mobile.
- Remove layout noise (inconsistent margins/paddings, doubled gaps, random overrides).
- Fix UX/UI issues that break alignment, readability, or accessibility—without changing content.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (do not break)
- Global container: max 1200px; gutters 24/24/32 (sm/md/lg+); centered.
- 12-column grid; gaps 24/24/32 (sm/md/lg+).
- Left alignment baseline (all text/media start on the same left edge).
- Home: text-only header (no hero image). Big two-column grid below (same as Sounds cards).
- Cards: bottom-aligned captions + unified badges (Artwork/Series/Sound or placeholder).
- Gallery: Series cards have “Series” badge; Series page lists ALL works immediately.
- Artwork page: two-column hero (LEFT boxed-cover image, RIGHT meta with labeled rows); no zoom.
- Scroll to top + focus main heading on every route change.

VERTICAL RHYTHM (tokens; multiples of 4px)
- Section padY: 64/64/72 (sm/md/lg+)
- Block gap (between sibling content blocks within a section): 24/24/32
- Heading spacing:
  H1: margin-top 0; margin-bottom 16
  H2: margin-top 40; margin-bottom 12
  H3: margin-top 32; margin-bottom 8
- Paragraph spacing: 16 between paragraphs; last-child margin-bottom 0
- Lists: 12 between items; 16 above/below the list block
- Figures (single media blocks): margin 24 above/below
- Cards grid gaps (Gallery/Series/All/Sounds/Home grid): 24/24/32
- Card caption: padding 12–16; inner gap 6–8; min-height stable so baselines align
- Artwork page (first screen):
  LEFT image box height: min(1000px, max(540px, 88vh)) desktop; ~65vh mobile
  RIGHT meta panel: row gap 16–20; “About This Work” (H3) has 24 above
- Series header (title/intro/meta) → works grid: 40/32/24 (lg/md/sm)
- Home header → grid: 40/32/24

CLEANUP RULES
- Single source of truth for spacing: use tokens; no magic numbers.
- Prefer margin-top on blocks for vertical rhythm; avoid mixing parent padding + child top margin that doubles space.
- Remove duplicate margins, collapsed-margin hacks, stray <br>, empty wrappers, and commented code.
- Ensure one <h1> per page; semantic order of headings.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Body contrast ≥ 7:1; base font ≥ 16px on mobile.
- Focus-visible on interactive elements.
- Route change: jump to top, focus main heading (tabindex="-1").

IMPLEMENTATION
1) Create/verify spacing tokens (CSS vars or Tailwind theme) and apply them to sections/blocks/components.
2) Normalize all page templates (Home, Gallery, Series, All, Artwork, Sounds, Statement, Contacts) to use:
   - container + grid
   - section padY
   - block gaps
   - heading/paragraph/list spacing rules
3) Remove per-component ad-hoc margins; replace with tokens.
4) Ensure card components share the same caption structure and reserved badge row.
5) Verify scroll-to-top + focus behavior on route change (ignore hash).

OUTPUT (STRICT)
1) SUMMARY table: {Page/Area, IssuesFound, FixesApplied, Risk, Notes}
2) TOKENS: show patch for spacing tokens (CSS variables or tailwind.config)
3) PER-FILE DIFFS: unified diffs (old → new)
4) VISUAL CHECKLIST (pass/fail):
   - containers equal width; left baselines aligned
   - section padY consistent
   - heading/paragraph/list spacing per tokens
   - grid gaps per tokens (24/24/32)
   - cards bottom-aligned; badges stable
   - artwork hero two-column: image box cover, meta rows labeled
   - series page: header → grid spacing correct; lists all works
   - mobile: single column; rhythm preserved
5) TODO (if any): short list with rationale
6) TESTS performed: viewports (360/768/1024/1280), Chrome/Safari/Firefox, keyboard-only nav, Lighthouse scores

DO NOTS
- Do not alter copy, routes, or business logic.
- Do not introduce new visual styles outside tokens.
- Do not add animations beyond existing subtle transitions.
