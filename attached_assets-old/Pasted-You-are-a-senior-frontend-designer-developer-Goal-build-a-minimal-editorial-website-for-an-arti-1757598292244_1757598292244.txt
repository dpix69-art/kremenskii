You are a senior frontend designer & developer.
Goal: build a minimal editorial website for an artist using the provided content structure (Gallery with series: Farbkoerper, PGSRD, Singles, Graphics; Sounds projects; Statement; Contacts). 
Style: calm, clean, typographic, with generous whitespace. No marketing CTAs.

### TYPOGRAPHY
- Font stack (web-safe, neutral grotesk):
  --font-sans: "Inter", "IBM Plex Sans", system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Arial, "Noto Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
- Type scale (px / line-height / weight):
  H1: 40 / 1.2 / 600
  H2: 30 / 1.25 / 600
  H3: 22 / 1.35 / 600
  Body: 17 / 1.65 / 400
  Small: 13 / 1.40 / 400
- Paragraph spacing: 16–20px between paragraphs.
- Uppercase meta labels (optional): letter-spacing +0..+0.2px.
- Links: same color as text; underline on hover/focus only.

### COLORS (neutral, content-first)
--bg: #FFFFFF
--fg: #0A0A0A
--muted: #666666
--line: #EDEDED
Use color only for media; UI is monochrome.

### LAYOUT & GRID

- Max page width: 1200px; side gutters ≥ 24px.
- Section vertical rhythm: 64px top/bottom; within section 24px.
- Breakpoints: sm 640, md 768, lg 1024, xl 1280.
- Mobile: single column; images flow in content. 
- Desktop (lg+): align figures to the reading column; avoid complex multi-column layouts.

3) Gallery:
   - Series index for ["Farbkoerper","Plywood-Gravel-Sand-Road-Dust (PGSRD)","Singles","Graphics"].

### ACCESSIBILITY & SEO
